    <h1>Technology</h1>
    

    <p>Technology can be confusing to most people, and I understand that, but I just want to make clear the technologies I would use to get your site up and running. </p>
<h2>WordPress</h2>
<p>I have a preference for WordPress, as it requires less regular maintenance for content to stay up and gives you, the user more control over the experience of your site, since it is customizable without having to go into code. </p>
<h2>Pelican</h2>
<p>For a site that is like this one, edited with code and managed by a professional, but not having many interactive elements, like logins or comments sections. I'd use Pelican, which is a generator of static sites. Now, that may sound like jargon, but what it really means is that this site is an old-fashioned website that simply lists and links information, interactivity is limited, and it must be maintained by someone who is comfortable messing about in the server itself rather than through a front end. However there is less maintenance and work involved than with the third option. It will also run faster than a WordPress site, and a small, one-time site would require less interaction on your part. </p>
<h2>Rails</h2>
<p>Rails is similar to Pelican in that it generates a website, but it is dynamic like WordPress, this solution would be best for a larger, more customizable and interactive site that would require interactive features. I can set up logins with Google, Facebook, and Twitter using this, and create a truly premium, first-rate site that wouldn't look or act out of place on a large company's site. Again, like Pelican, there is coding and backend work to be done in order to change this kind of site, and if you're making frequent changes, I'll be there to take care of it for ya. </p>
<h2>DigitalOcean</h2>
<p>I personally use DigitalOcean for my hosting needs. Now, what does that mean? Well, every website has a computer that's sharing it on the internet, called a server, and the servers "host" websites. DigitalOcean basically rents space on the web for you or anyone else to use, where you can put whatever you want on the server because it's yours. There are some places where this kind of thing would be restricted in some way, but with DigitalOcean there's tons of flexibility, and maintenance tools that I'm familiar with and that are wonderful to have in case of any issues.</p>
