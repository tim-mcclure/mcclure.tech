#About me

My name is Timothy McClure. I am a self taught web developer and IT worker. I can set you up with a website, your own personal email address, and repair your personal computer or laptop. Just send me an email, and we'll get in touch!

##Web Development 

For any web job, I am a one-stop shop for any development needs. I can set you up with a server to host your website and/or your personal email address. I can get you your personal domain, and I can set the site up with an easy to use and easy to change website with WordPress. I can also manage your web site from setup to give you a customizable, personalized website. 

##Computer Repair

I have been building and troubleshooting general personal computer issues for years. Any hardware or software issue, I've got a solution for you. From crashed hard drives to virus infections, I have dealt with it all.
