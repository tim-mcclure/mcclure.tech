Title: About

I'm Timothy McClure. I make websites and fix computers. Need a site? Just email me! Need a computer fixed, do the same!

##Web Development 

From design to deployment, I can help any small business or individual get their own website up and running. I can even get you in control of your own site through technologies such as WordPress so that you can control your own site through an easy-to-use interface whenever it comes up. I can help guide you through the entire process to make sure you have a professional, beautiful website that will represent your business or personality in the best possible light. 

##Computer Repair

I'm also a freelance PC technician, I can take a look, most likely fix whatever's going on and we can move on from there. I can get you PC running like it hasn't in years, from general hardware repairs, to sofware cleaning and optimization.
