Title: Pelican
Date: 2016-07-11 10:18

Pelican is a static site generator, I'm using on this site because I just thought I'd try something a little different for myself while I'm here. It's still a work in progress, but I'm thinking I'll just make this a general technology blog, just to get my name out there on the interwebs. I'd like it to be a more casual experience than a "professional" site, so I'll just put opinions and stuff on here. 

This is just to add a page to the site while it's being made, so here it is! Just hosting this on DigitalOcean, which I recommend wholeheartedly to any dev, since you just get a server with root access you can do pretty much whatever you want to do with, and you get a ton of web-based management options. Price point is right, too, if you just want to do some hobbying with it. 

I'm currently working on the theme, and hopefully it'll be done by the time this site is up.
